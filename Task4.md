Do the following action plan steps to update the project and all code needed.  
If needed, you should ask clarifying questions before you answer or action.  
If decision have an alternative, you should provide a reason for the best choice.  

Action plan:  
1. On the top level of the repository create a folder named `web` and add a simple web page that interacts with the REST API.  
2. Create a Dockerfile with a lightweight web server to serve the web page.  
3. Create a compose file to run the web server in a container.  
4. Write detailed instructions on how to build, run and deploy the containerized web server in the `web/docs/instructions.md` file.  

After successful completion of this task and in case of discrepancy between the task and the result, you may update the task file with a readjusted instruction prompt that matches all completed steps.
